    On February 12, 2024, Ledger announced a new vision for the [ Ledger ] Market Pass NFT also know as the [ Ledger ] Market Pass - Genesis edition NFT.

    It’s an exciting day for us as we get to present to you the next phase of the [ Ledger ] Market Pass. 

    Enter SZN II: For SZN II of the [ Ledger ] Market Pass, which we’re calling the Ledger Community Pass, we will be focusing on curating unique drops from throughout the community to give holders the ability to be at the forefront of digital art and dive into its many facets. We aim to leverage the ecosystem’s network to provide holders with regular access to exclusive perks, along with exciting giveaways and fun raffles to keep things lively and grow the community. Finally, we want to deliver valuable monthly content and create opportunities for real-world connections.

    Our Approach: Our pass is going to evolve right alongside our community and the broader ecosystem. We're firm believers in the power of collaboration, where the SZN II - Community Pass grows and reflects the values and ambition of Ledger and its community. We're here to listen, to care, and to create something meaningful together.

    Now, let's talk about the team behind the scenes driving this new chapter. You've got @Morels, @G4sp4rd, and @JJB - each of them brings solid experience in the NFT and digital art space and a real passion for crypto culture. But it's not just about them; they're backed by a network which we’re confident will truly benefit our pass holders. We want to make sure wherever Ledger goes within the ecosystem, our holders are right there with us, soaking up as much value as possible.
    
    The imminent future: Starting today, your Ledger Market Pass - Genesis Edition NFT will automatically transition into the [ Ledger ] Market Pass SZN II - Community Pass. No need for any additional action on your end; it'll happen automatically and the new metadata and image for the Community Pass should be reflected in Ledger Live and on all NFT Markets that support Ethereum NFTs.

    While we're eagerly anticipating what lies ahead, there's even more in store, and your input is essential to us. We'd also love to hear which projects you'd like us to collaborate with, as these partnerships are for you. We also can’t wait to have new holders join us.
