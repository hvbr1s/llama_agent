        This article addresses the most frequently asked questions about Ledger's Bitcoin Halving  2024 sale. To learn more, please visit: https://shop.ledger.com/pages/bitcoin-halving-offer

        1- When is the sale happening?
    
        The Bitcoin Halving sale begins on Tuesday, April 9th and continues through Tuesday, April 16th, 2024. Please note, the sale does not include Wednesday, April 17th, 2024.
    
        2- Can I apply the promotion to an order I placed before the Bitcoin Halving sale began?
    
        We cannot retroactively apply the Bitcoin Halving promotion to orders placed before Tuesday, April 9th, 2024. However, if you ordered before the start of the sale and received your package within the last 14 days, you can return it for a refund via the My Order page at my-order.ledger.com and then reorder using the Bitcoin Halving promotion. 
    
        3- I bought a Backup or a Family pack/bundle during the Bitcoin Halving sale, but I did not receive the promotional gift card. Why not?
    
    The Bitcoin Halving promotion does not include the Backup pack or the Family pack. It applies specifically to special Ledger Nano Duo bundles, which include a Ledger Nano X and a Ledger Nano S Plus, as well as to individual black Ledger Nano X and Nano S Plus devices and selected accessories like the Cryptotag Zeus which is metal seed storage solution for your recovery phrase.
    
        4- Are colored Ledger devices part of the promotion?
        No, colored Ledger devices (Nano S Plus and Nano X) are not included in the Bitcoin Halving deals. Deals only apply to black devices.
    
        5- I used a referral link to purchase but didn't get the $10 gift card. Why?
        The Refer-a-Friend gift card cannot be combined with the Bitcoin Halving promotion. However, you can still earn rewards if your friends buy individual devices using your referral link during the sale.
    
        6- I made a purchase during the Bitcoin Halvening promotion campaign but did not receive the gift card. Why?
    
        Please ensure the following:
    
        a. Purchase Date and Time: Verify that your purchase was made during the Bitcoin Halving period, which is from Tuesday, April 9th at 12pm CET and continues through Tuesday, April 16th, 2024.
        b. Eligible Products: Confirm that your purchase included individual black Ledger Nano S Plus, Nano X devices. Please note that regular packs/bundles or colored Ledger Nano devices do not qualify for the Bitcoin Halving promotion.
        c. Excluded Accessories: Be aware that some accessories, such as the Cryptosteel and Billfold, are not part of this offer. However, the Cryptotag Zeus does qualify.
    
        d. Options for Ineligible Orders: If your order does not qualify for the Bitcoin Halving promotion, you have the opportunity to cancel it within 14 days and place a new order that meets the eligibility criteria. For order cancellation, visit the My Order page at my-order.ledger.com.
    
        If your order meets all the above conditions and you still haven't received your gift card, please reach out to Ledger Support at https://support.ledger.com/ for further assistance.
    
        7- I cannot find the promotional scratch card in the Ledger box.
        That is expected. TheBitcoin halving gift card is a physical card sent in a separate envelope with your order, not inside the Ledger box itself. We will send one envelope for each eligible item, with a limit of five items per order.
    
        8- How do I use the promotional Bitcoin Halving card?
        Simply scratch off the card to reveal a promotional code. Then, navigate to the Refer a Friend (RAF) app found in the 'Discover' section of the Ledger Live app. There, you can redeem your code and claim your promotional Bitcoin (BTC). 30 days after having redeemed your code, you will need to claim your Bitcoin (BTC) in your Refer-a-friend account and provide a Bitcoin Address. When selecting the option to claim your Reward you can select one of the Bitcoin Addresses proposed or enter a new one.
     
        9 I want to return my Bitcoin Halving sale order. Can I get a refund?
        You have 14 days from the date of delivery to return your order and get a full refund. Keep in mind that the unscratched gift card needs to be returned as well.
